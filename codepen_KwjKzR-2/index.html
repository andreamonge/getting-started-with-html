  Basic overview of <b>"the web"</b><br>
<br>
<p>The main type of documents on the web are made with a language called <em>HTML</em>.
<em>HTML</em> stands for <em>"Hypertext Markup Language"</em>. Another types of documents we can find on the web are: PDF, images, plain text, videos, music and basically anything you like.</p>
<br>
  To understand what <b>"the web"</b> is, we can break it up in parts:
  <br>
  <br>
  1) <em>Your computer + browser</em>: A browser is a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web. e.g. Google Chrome, Firefox, others.<br>
  2) <em>The internet</em>: is the world's larger computer network.<br>
  3)<em>HTTP</em>: is the main protocol of the web, used by your computer to communicate with the servers. <br>
  4) <em>Servers</em>: are big computers hosting the files that make up the web.<br><br>

  How does it work?<br>

  <p>Your computer (through your favorite browser) makes requests via the internet to the server, using a protocol called <em>HTTP</em>. After that, the server responds with files that your browser displays in your computer.

<b>Introduction to <em>HTML</em></b><br><br>

<em>HTML</em> stands for <em>"Hypertext Markup Language"</em>. It is basically <em>"The heart of the Web"</em>.<br>
<br>
<em>HTML</em> is made of: <br><br>

1. Text content: is what you see.<br>
2. Markup: what it looks like.<br>
3. References to other documents.e.g: images + videos.<br>
4. Links to other pages<br>
<br>

<em>HTML Markup
</em>

<em>HTML Markup</em> is made of tags. To understand this better, refer to <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444">this video</a>.
<br>
<br>
Its basic structure is the following:<br><br>

 <em>tag - content - tag</em> <br> <br>

 <em>-Tags:</em>

<p> Tags are always contained within angle brackets. Most of them have an opening and a closing tag. Some of them doesn't require a closing tag (called void tags).</p>
 For an example of a tag watch <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48011976/m-48703273">this video</a>.<br><br>
<em>-Content:</em><br><br>

Contents could be other tags or just text.<br><br>

<em>-Elements</em>: <br><br>
The structure (tag - content - tag) is called an element. But sometimes a tag might be called an element as well. <br><BR></BR>

<em>Other HTML jargon</em>:<br><br>

<br>

<em>-HTML Attributes:</em>

These are properties of an <em>HTML element</em>. It has the following structure: <br><br>

<em> tag - atribute = "atributes value" - contents - tag </em>
<br>
<br>
For an example of how to use <em>"attributes"</em> watch <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48508417/m-48723411">the following video</a>.

<b>End Notes</b>: <br><br>

-How coding works: coding is a language we use to communicate with computers.
<br><br>
- Computers are stupid: this means programmers should write exactly what the computer understands. Otherwise, there will be problems with its function. 
<br><br>
-Programmers can't remember everything: don't feel bad if you can't remember how to type something in HTML language. You can always look it up! :).
